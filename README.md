CODSOFT Python Programming Internship

Task 1:To-do List
This task is a command-line based To-Do List application created using Python. It allows users to add tasks, view all saved tasks, and delete tasks once they are completed. The program works through a simple menu system where users select options by entering numbers, which makes it easy to understand and use.
Through this task, I practiced working with lists, functions, loops, and user input in Python. It helped me understand how to organize data and build small interactive programs.

Task 2:Calculator
The second task is a simple calculator built using Python’s Tkinter library. 
This application provides a graphical user interface where users can perform 
basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, 
and division. The calculator takes input through on-screen buttons and 
displays the result instantly, making it easy to use and visually interactive.

Task 3:Password Generator (GUI)  
The third task is a password generator with a graphical user interface. The user can enter the desired password length and choose whether to include uppercase letters, numbers, and symbols. The program then generates a strong random password and displays it on the screen. This task helped me understand how to use random functions, string manipulation, and Tkinter widgets to build a real desktop application.

More tasks will be added to this repository as I continue working on the internship.

Task 4: Rock–Paper–Scissors Game
This task is a Rock–Paper–Scissors game built using Python with a graphical user interface. The user selects rock, paper, or scissors using buttons, while the computer randomly chooses one option. The program compares both choices using the game rules and instantly displays whether the user wins, loses, or the match is a tie. The application also keeps track of the score for both the user and the computer, making it feel like a real game. This task helped me understand random number generation, conditional logic, and event handling in Python.
