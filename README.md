CODSOFT Python Programming Internship
Task 1:To-do List
This task is a command-line based To-Do List application created using Python. It allows users to add tasks, view all saved tasks, and delete tasks once they are completed. The program works through a simple menu system where users select options by entering numbers, which makes it easy to understand and use.
Through this task, I practiced working with lists, functions, loops, and user input in Python. It helped me understand how to organize data and build small interactive programs.

Task 2:Calculator
The second task is a simple calculator built using Python’s Tkinter library. 
This application provides a graphical user interface where users can perform 
basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, 
and division. The calculator takes input through on-screen buttons and 
displays the result instantly, making it easy to use and visually interactive.

Task 3:Password Generator (GUI)  
The third task is a password generator with a graphical user interface. The user can enter the desired password length and choose whether to include uppercase letters, numbers, and symbols. The program then generates a strong random password and displays it on the screen. This task helped me understand how to use random functions, string manipulation, and Tkinter widgets to build a real desktop application.

More tasks will be added to this repository as I continue working on the internship.
